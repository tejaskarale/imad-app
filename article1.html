        Hii, Here i am going to share something about my life. I am tejas karale borned in small village and upgrone too in small  village . I basically belongs to the farmer family and i love all my family . Beacause of financial background it is raelly very difficult to send me for studies in the best schools, but then also my family is aware of the education and they send me to my taluka called BHOOM for my high school eduacation. There also initially i was afraid of the students from city and my confidance level had gone down thinking that only students in city are better than us . But gradually i learned all things and i got to know about my abilities.
